GOOGL Stock Price Prediction using RNN with LSTM
- LSTM introduces the memory cell, a unit of computation that replaces traditional artificial neurons in the hidden layer of the network. With these memory cells, networks are able to effectively associate memories and input remote in time, hence suit to grasp the structure of data dynamically over time with high prediction capacity.

- Rolling means (moving averages) are used to smooth out short-term fluctuations in time series data and highlight long-term trends.
- Keras is used to build the model &  Adam optimizer has been used because it combines the perks of two other optimizers: ADAgrad and RMSprop.
